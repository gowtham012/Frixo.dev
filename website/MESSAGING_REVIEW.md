# Frixo.dev — Messaging Review

## Please review before I update the website

## THE PROBLEM (Refined)

There is no single platform to build, maintain, and ship AI agents.

Today, developers juggle multiple tools:
- **Framework** → Need one tool (LangChain, CrewAI, etc.)
- **Tracing** → Need another tool (LangSmith, etc.)
- **Evals** → Need another tool (Promptfoo, etc.)
- **A2A** → Some frameworks support it, some don't — fragmented
- **Deployment** → DIY on cloud providers
- **Self-Evolving** → Nobody supports this
- **Memory** → Build it yourself
- **Multi-LLM fallback** → Build it yourself

**Result:** Fragmented ecosystem, no production compliance, agents break when LLMs go down.

---

**Frixo.dev** — The all-in-one platform for AI agents.

**One prompt → Production-ready agent.**
