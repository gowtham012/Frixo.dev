# Frixo.dev — One Pager

**Tagline:** One prompt. Any agent.

## The Problem

**There is no single platform to build, maintain, and ship AI agents.**

Today, developers juggle 6+ different tools:

| Need | Current Solution | Problem |
|------|------------------|---------|
| Framework | LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen | Just building, no production support |
| Tracing | LangSmith, Arize, Helicone | Separate tool, separate dashboard |
| Evals | Promptfoo, Braintrust | Another tool, another integration |
| A2A | Some frameworks have it, some don't | Fragmented, inconsistent |
| Memory | Build it yourself | No standard solution |
| Multi-LLM | Build it yourself | Single point of failure |
| Deployment | DIY on AWS/GCP | No agent-native deployment |
| Self-Evolving | ❌ Nobody | Doesn't exist |
| Marketplace | ❌ Nobody | Can't monetize your agents |

**The result:**
- 6+ subscriptions, 6+ dashboards
- Fragmented data, no unified view
- Agents break when LLMs go down
- No way to sell agents you build
- No production compliance out of the box

## The Solution

**Frixo.dev** — One prompt. Any agent. Production-ready.

Describe your agent in one prompt. We build it with everything integrated — evals, tracing, A2A, memory, multi-LLM fallback. Deploy with one click. Sell on our marketplace.

---

## Core Features

### 1. Build Any Agent from One Prompt
Not limited like other SaaS platforms. Describe any type of agent — we build it complete with all integrations.

### 2. Self-Evolving Agents
Agents improve over time based on usage and feedback. Approval required only for production changes.

### 3. Agent Marketplace
Build agents. Sell them. Agent builders can monetize their work on our marketplace.

## How It Works

```
1. DESCRIBE    →  Tell us what your agent should do (one prompt)
2. BUILD       →  We create the agent with all integrations
3. TEST        →  Evals run automatically
4. DEPLOY      →  One-click deployment
5. EVOLVE      →  Agent improves (you approve prod changes)
6. SELL        →  List on marketplace (optional)
```
