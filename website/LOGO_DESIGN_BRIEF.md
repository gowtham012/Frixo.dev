# Frixo.dev Logo Design Brief

## Brand Overview

**Brand Name:** Frixo.dev
**Industry:** Developer Tools / AI Agent Platform
**Tagline:** One prompt. Any agent.

### What We Do
Frixo.dev is the **all-in-one platform** for AI agents.

**The Problem:** Today, developers juggle 6+ separate tools — framework, tracing, evals, A2A (fragmented across frameworks), memory, multi-LLM fallback, and deployment. No single platform. No way to monetize agents. No self-evolving agents.

**Our Solution:** One prompt. Any agent. Describe what you need — we build it with everything integrated: evals, tracing, A2A, memory, multi-LLM fallback. Deploy with one click. Sell on our marketplace. Agents evolve and improve over time.

### Key Features
- Build ANY type of agent from one prompt
- Self-evolving agents (approval for prod only)
- Agent Marketplace (build and sell)
- Integrated evals, tracing, A2A
- Multi-LLM support (never offline)
- Short & long-term memory
- Visual + code workflow builder
- Open-source SDK (launching soon)

### Target Audience
- Software developers and engineers
- AI/ML engineers
- Technical founders and CTOs
- DevOps and platform teams

## Logo Requirements

### Deliverables Needed

| Variant | Description | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Logomark (Icon)** | Symbol only, no text | Favicon, app icon, small spaces, social media avatar |
| **Full Logo (Horizontal)** | Symbol + "Frixo.dev" wordmark | Navbar, headers, marketing materials |
| **Wordmark Only** | Just "Frixo.dev" text styled | Alternative for text-heavy contexts |

### Formats Required
- SVG (primary, scalable)
- PNG (transparent background, multiple sizes: 32px, 64px, 128px, 256px, 512px)
- ICO (for favicon)

---

## Style Direction

### Must Be
- **Simple** — Clean, uncluttered, works at small sizes
- **Minimalist** — No unnecessary elements, every part has purpose
- **Technical** — Feels like a developer/coding brand, not generic SaaS

### Avoid
- Overly complex illustrations
- Generic tech clichés (globes, abstract swooshes)
- Clip art or stock-style graphics
- Gradients that don't scale well
- Anything that looks dated or trendy

---

## Brand Personality

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Professional** | Enterprise-ready, trustworthy |
| **Technical** | Built by developers, for developers |
| **Modern** | Current, forward-thinking |
| **Precise** | Attention to detail, quality-focused |

---

## Color Palette

### Primary Colors (from existing brand)

| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| **Cyan (Primary)** | `#00D4FF` | Primary accent, highlights, ".dev" text |
| **Purple (Secondary)** | `#A855F7` | Secondary accent, optional use |
| **White/Light Gray** | `#E5E7EB` | Text on dark backgrounds |
| **Dark Background** | `#0a0a0f` | Site background |

### Logo Color Versions Needed
1. **Full color** — Cyan primary (on dark background)
2. **Monochrome light** — White/light gray (for dark backgrounds)
3. **Monochrome dark** — Black/dark gray (for light backgrounds)

## Name Analysis

**F-R-I-X-O**

Potential symbolism to explore:
- **F** — First letter, strong starting point
- **X** — Technical, variable, intersection point
- **O** — Completion, output, cycle, zero (binary)
- **.dev** — Developer domain, code, technical identity

### Name Origin
"Frixo" suggests flow and reduced friction—making AI agent development frictionless.

---

## Technical Considerations

### Where Logo Will Appear
- Website navbar (height: 32px)
- Website footer
- Favicon (16x16, 32x32)
- GitHub organization avatar
- Social media profiles (Twitter, Discord)
- Documentation site
- CLI tool splash screen
- Email signatures

### Scalability Requirements
- Must be recognizable at 16x16 pixels (favicon)
- Must look sharp at large sizes (marketing)
- Single-color version must work

---

## Inspiration Direction

Consider elements from:
- Code syntax (`< />`, `{ }`, `=>`)
- Terminal/command line aesthetics
- Circuit or node patterns
- Geometric precision
- Monospace typography influence

### Reference Brands (style, not copy)
- Vercel — Clean, minimal, geometric
- Linear — Refined, technical elegance
- Stripe — Professional yet distinctive
- Raycast — Developer-focused clarity

---

## Current Brand Display

Currently using text-only:
```
